I have spent the last few years of my life as an educator, working primarily with early childhood development.  I have a Bachelors of Arts in Interdisciplinary Studies from the University of Texas at San Antonio.  This portfolio is a good way to keep track of the progress made throughout the journey, beginning with simple code refactors and working my way up to more and more complex projects. I plan to keep updating this portfolio as my journey continues.</p>
                        <p className="mb-5">This is the third version of my portfolio, starting with a simple page with html and css and evolving into a single page react app currently.</p>
